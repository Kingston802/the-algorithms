A coffee-book style look at algorithms inspired by "The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe" by Theodore Gray. 
That book inspired me to explore science by presenting the elements in a beautiful and easy to digest format. 
That's what I hope to accomplish with this project but for algorithms. 

To do this we shall follow some key tenets:
  1. All explanations should be written using [the 1000 most common English words](https://1000mostcommonwords.com/1000-most-common-english-words/)
  2. Code should be beautiful. Python is beautiful. Code should be written in compliant Python. 
  3. The explanations should be practical. They should explain why you should use an algorithm and when not to.
