## An Algorithm
> a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

A coffee-book style look at algorithms inspired by "The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe" by Theodore Gray. 
That book inspired me to explore science by presenting the elements in a beautiful and easy to digest format. 
That's what I hope to accomplish with this project but for algorithms. 

To do this we shall follow some key tenets*:
  1. All explanations should be written using [the 1000 most common English words](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/20k.txt)
  2. Code should be beautiful. Python is beautiful. Code should be written in compliant **Python**. 
  3. The explanations should be **practical**. They should explain why you should use an algorithm and when not to. 

## *
1. You can use words that you define, for example, "Algorithm" is not actually in the 1000 most common words (its #4249) but we can use it because it was defined at the start of this README. Additionally, proper nouns (such as "README") are allowed because you are effectively defining them through context. 
2. The 1000 most common English words are defined by a filtered list of the Google most common 20k words.
