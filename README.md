## An Algorithm
> a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

A coffee-book style look at algorithms inspired by "The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe" by Theodore Gray. 
That book inspired me to explore science by presenting the elements in a beautiful and easy to digest format. 
That's what I hope to accomplish with this project but for algorithms. 

To do this we shall follow some key tenets:
  1. Code should be beautiful. Python is beautiful. Code should be written in compliant **Python**. 
  2. The explanations should be **practical**. They should explain why you should use an algorithm and when not to.
